# Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Simon!

An aspiring Web3 developer and curious hacker on an exciting journey to build decentralized applications (dApps) and smart contracts. I thrive on experimenting with code, breaking things to learn how they work, and exploring the edges of blockchain technology.

---

## About Me

I'm deep-diving into Web3 with a hacker's mindset â€” learning by building, debugging, and reverse-engineering. My focus is on writing secure, efficient smart contracts using **Solidity**, and bringing them to life with **Web3.js** and other front-end tools. I love dissecting protocols and figuring out how to push systems to their limits.

## Languages & Technologies

My current toolkit includes a strong foundation in these languages:

## Blockchain Focus

I'm actively learning and experimenting with:

## What I'm Tinkering With

* **Advanced Solidity Patterns** â€“ Proxies, upgradeability, and gas hacks.
* **DeFi Protocols** â€“ Reverse-engineering on-chain logic to understand value flows.
* **Layer 2 Solutions** â€“ Playing with ZK rollups, bridging strategies, and EVM quirks.
* **Security Audits** â€“ Practicing exploit hunting and learning to think like an attacker.

## Connect with Me

I'm always down to share code, ideas, or weird bugs. Hit me up:

Let's break things, fix them, and build something decentralized together.
